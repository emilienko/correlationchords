<u>correlationchords: A Circular Chord Diagram of Correlations for Stata</u>

<b>Description:</b>

correlationchords is a highly customizable circular chord graph that visualizes the significance level obtained when performing an independence test for all possible combinations of two of a list of variables.

<b>Program Limitations:</b>

1. Due to the complexity of the syntax of the program, it is recomended to run it through its dialog box.

2. Processing time for the variables increases quadratically depending on the number of variables to be analyzed. Therefore, graphs intended to check the relationship among a large list of variables may require a long time to calculate.

3. Users of the more basic versions of Stata (StataBE) should not have issues when analyzing 30 or fewer variables, but due to the variable limit, they may experience problems beyond this number.

4. correlationchords is not suitable for quantitative variables and should only be used for qualitative variables.
